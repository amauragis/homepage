This is a collection of interesting things I may have worked on, but right now it's pretty incomplete.

Oculus-ASR
----------
At [Michigan Technological University](www.mtu.edu), as an alternative to a Senior Capstone project, there are a number
of groups called "Enterprises" that allow undergraduates to work on a longer-term team project with real-world goals
and interactions.  One of those enterprises, the [Aerospace Enterprise](www.aerospace.mtu.edu) is responsible for the
Oculus-ASR microsatellite, part of the Air Force Research Lab's University Nanosat Program (AFRL UNP). Oculus-ASR was
the winner of the sixth iteration of the UNP program, and is scheduled to launch on a Falcon Heavy on STP-2.  Since
the official end of the sixth competition in January 2011, the team has been finalizing and integrating
the flight hardware.

I was responsible for the design and implementation of the satellites communication system, redesign of the battery
charge controller, and systems engineering.

Equiangular Spiral Antenna
--------------------------
[[paper]](projects/antenna.pdf)

One of my later courses at [MTU](www.mtu.edu) was in antenna design.  At the end of the course, students designed and modelled
custom built antennas.  We chose to design an equiangular spiral antenna, [originally proposed by John Dyson in 1959](http://www.google.com/patents/US2958081).
Our target bandwidth was 10:1, but due to construction problems, we were limited to a narrower band.

The antenna was constructed using a 1/32" copper sheet fastened to an acrylic sheet for stability, and fed with a copper
hardline.  We used FEKO to simulate the antenna results and verified them in an anechoic chamber on campus.
