Oculus-ASR
----------
At [Michigan Technological University](www.mtu.edu), as an alternative to a Senior Capstone project, there are a number
of groups called "Enterprises" that allow undergraduates to work on a longer-term team project with real-world goals
and interactions.  One of those enterprises, the [Aerospace Enterprise](www.aerospace.mtu.edu) is responsible for the
Oculus-ASR microsatellite, part of the Air Force Research Lab's University Nanosat Program (AFRL UNP). Oculus-ASR was
the winner of the sixth iteration of the UNP program, and is scheduled to launch on a Falcon Heavy on STP-2.  Since
the official end of the sixth competition in January 2011, the team has been finalizing and integrating
the flight hardware.

I was responsible for the design and implementation of the satellites communication system, redesign of the battery
charge controller, and systems engineering.
