 abstract = {The power grid is one of humanity's most significant engineering
	 undertakings and it is essential in developed and developing nations
		 alike.  Currently, transparency into the power grid relies on
		 utility companies and more fine-grained insight is provided by
		 costly smart meter deployments. We claim that greater
		 visibility into power grid conditions can be provided in an
		 inexpensive and crowd-sourced manner independent of utility
		 companies by leveraging existing smartphones.  Our key insight
		 is that an unmodified smartphone can detect power outages by
		 monitoring changes to its own power state, locally verifying
		 these outages using a variety of sensors that reduce the
		 likelihood of false power outage reports, and corroborating
		 actual reports with other phones through data aggregation in
		 the cloud.  The proposed approach enables a decentralized
		 system that can scale, potentially providing researchers and
		 concerned citizens with a powerful new tool to analyze the
		 power grid and hold utility companies accountable for poor
		 power quality.  This paper demonstrates the viability of the
		 basic idea, identifies a number of challenges that are
		 specific to this application as well as ones that are common
		 to many crowd-sourced applications, and highlights some
		 improvements to smartphone operating systems that could better
		 support such applications in the future.},

	abstract = {A 1.0~mm general-purpose sensor node platform with heterogeneous multi-layer structure is proposed.  The sensor platform benefits from modularity by allowing the addition/removal of IC layers. A new low power I$^2$C interface is introduced for energy efficient inter-layer communication with compatibility to commercial I$^2$C protocols. A self-adapting power management unit is proposed for efficient battery voltage down conversion for wide range of battery voltages and load current. The power management unit also adapts itself by monitoring energy harvesting conditions and harvesting sources and is capable of harvesting from solar, thermal and microbial fuel cells. An optical wakeup receiver is proposed for sensor node programming and synchronization with 228~pW standby power. The system also includes two processors, timer, temperature sensor, and low-power imager. Standby power of the system is 11~nW.},
